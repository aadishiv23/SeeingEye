# SeeingEye

SeeingEye is machine learning based pedestrian light detector for visually impaired individuals that can be used as a guidance tool to help them navigate across pedestrian crossings.

According to a 2009 paper, Audible Beaconing with Accessible Pedestrian Signals
, "although Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) are often assumed to provide wayfinding information, the type of APS that has been typically installed in the U.S has not had positive effects on finding crosswalks, locating pushbuttons, or providing directional guidance"

The SeeingEye app is made for iOS devices only and utilizes Swift, SwiftUI and UIKit to achieve its functions
Frameworks involved include AVFoundation, CoreML, Vision

A YOLO-based ML model was developed and trained, the results of which can be seen below:
